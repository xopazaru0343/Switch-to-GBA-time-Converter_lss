# Switch to GBA converter

The original Game Boy Advance runs games at 59.7275 frames per second. This is the standard that has been used to time all GBA runs that have been performed. The Nintendo Switch Online GBA Emulator, however, runs games at 60 frames per second. This creates a slight time discripancy that should be accounted for to maintain competitive integrity. This script accomplishes that by simply converting the time achieved for a run on Switch to what the run would be on a GBA.
